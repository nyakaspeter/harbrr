# Multi-stage build for harbrr. The binary is pure-Go (CGO_ENABLED=0), so the
# final image is a tiny non-root Alpine with just the static binary.

# The build stage stays on the native runner platform (BUILDPLATFORM) and Go
# cross-compiles to the requested target (TARGETOS/TARGETARCH, injected by buildx),
# so a multi-arch build never pays for an emulated Go toolchain. CGO is off, so this
# is a pure cross-compile. For a plain `docker build` the target args are empty and
# Go builds for the host.

# The Go build embeds web/dist (the compiled SPA). A plain local `docker build` from a
# fresh clone has an empty web/dist (dist/.gitkeep only), which would otherwise silently
# ship a UI-less binary whose pages answer "frontend not built". Fail loudly instead:
# build the SPA first (`make web-build`) so `docker build` picks it up from the context,
# or pull a published image. In CI this whole `build` stage is replaced by a
# prebuilt-binary build-context, so this guard never runs there.

# Everything the final image needs that would otherwise require running a shell in the
# target architecture, assembled here on the NATIVE build platform. Same alpine version
# as the final stage, so the artifacts copy across unchanged:
#   - ca-certificates + tzdata: architecture-independent data (the cert bundle Go reads
#     at /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt, and the zoneinfo database)
#   - the harbrr account and its /config dir: plain text in /etc/passwd + /etc/group and
#     a directory with a mode, none of which care about architecture
# Keeping this stage native is what lets the final stage hold zero RUN instructions, so a
# multi-arch build needs no QEMU at all — see the note above the final stage.
